# The Internet Revolution: From Dotcom Capitalism to Cybernetic Communism
<!-- backcover text -->
<span class="white">‘The Californian Ideology’ by Richard Barbrook and Andy Cameron is the symbol of the first wave of internet criticism as embodied by magazines such as Mute, where the essay first was published in 1995, and the nettime mailinglist, where it later appeared as well. The internet might have fundamentally changed in the two following decades, but Barbrook and Cameron’s biting criticism is still highly relevant. Their analysis and questioning of the economic and political agenda of the internet utopia and its prophets remain shocking and provocative. In an introduction written especially for this 20th anniversary edition Richard Barbrook takes a fresh look at the neoliberal hippies that shaped Silicon Valley and shows how their influence continues on to this day.</span>

<span class="white">Written prior to the infiltration of the internet to mass markets, ‘The Californian Ideology’ is a visionary and pioneering critique on the Net neoliberalism movement that made waves through Silicon Valley in the early 90s. Barbrook and Cameron offer a rich perspective on the consequences this movement had for the early rise of the internet empire. They show how the struggle between left and right and their contrasting beliefs spawned a new surge of technological determinism throughout the tech community.</span>

<span class="white">Published four years later, ‘Cybernet Communism’ by Richard Barbrook offers a thought probe to stir up the thinking on technology and Silicon Valley. The Californian Ideologues have for the first time in human history made the only working model of communism possible. Funded by the US military, a Stalinist vision of the promised land has become reality. Looking at the future, this cyber-communism indicates that the free exchange of information and an economy of gifts is the way forward for the Net.  </span>
